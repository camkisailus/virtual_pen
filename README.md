This is an OpenCV project that tracks a pen around the screen and draws lines. It reminds me of a smart board.

Run by `python3 virutal_pen.py`

Adjust the HSV sliders so that only your drawing device (pen) is seen in the mask

Press `s` to save the values and proceed to drawing

Drawing will start immediately... cover the pen if don't want to draw anything

`e` turns the pen to an eraser and vice versa

`c` clears your drawing canvas

esc closes the program
