This is an OpenCV project that tracks a pen around the screen and draws lines. It reminds me of a smart board.

Run by `python3 virutal_pen.py`\n
Adjust the HSV sliders so that only your drawing device (pen) is seen in the mask\n
Press `s` to save the values and proceed to drawing\n
Drawing will start immediately... cover the pen if don't want to draw anything\n
`e` turns the pen to an eraser and vice versa\n
`c` clears your drawing canvas\n
esc closes the program\n
